# Do-Not-Disturb
Simple python script to enable do not disturb on a Mac for a set period of time or until a desired time. 

I would love any improvements- it's not a priority for me if it doesn't meet your needs (sorry). 

Change Notification Center status on Mac to "Do not disturb" for
a) n minutes, (n>4)
b) or n hours, (n<=4)
c) or until n time where n is in hour:minute format using 12 hour clock.

The concept of the split mode is that since Notification Center has a built-in
timer of 24 hours (1 day), usage of this script will be limited to 1/2 day or
less. Any longer... modify the script or just turn it off manually?
